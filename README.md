# profanify
A Node.js Packaged Module that functions to censor profane words for other modules using the package.

Why is version/source control important?
With Version Control System (VCS), you can revert files and entire project  back to a previous state upon notice that something has change compared to previous working states. In other words, you can easily recover lost files caused by human error or system file corruption. Lastly, VCS yields little overhead in trying to reinvent the wheel from modified files that might be causing a problem.

well done!
